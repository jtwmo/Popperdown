      <h1>Popper Down Charters</h1>
    </header>
      <div class="main">
        <p>Texas. Corpus Christi Bay. Early Morning.<br></p>
        <p>Calm.<br></p>
        <p>Guided by Captain Brett's steady hand, T.H.E. Kingfish slides gingerly from its resting place in the docks. The engine growls to life and settles into a deep, impatient rumble, joined only by the sound of the sun-dappled waves as they kiss the vessel's underbelly. Barnacle-encrusted "NO WAKE" signs stand silent guard at the entrance to the bay, and as the Captain tips his hat in respect, another sound joins the hushed morning chorus.</p>
        <p>"Popper down..."</p>
        <p>"Fish on..."</p>
        <p>"In the box..."</p>
        <p>As quickly as the sea-salt wind steals the words away, they come again.</p>
        <p>"Popper down..."</p>
        <p>"Fish on..."</p>
        <p>"In the box..."</p>
        <p>With deftness that can only be achieved by hands that have practiced motions countless times, the final preparations are made. Like a priest and his rosary, each movement is paired to the beat of the old sea captain's mantra.</p>
        <p>"Popper down..." The rods are secured, eagerly awaiting their freedom.</p>
        <p>"Fish on..." The prop is lowered into the water, pleased to be home once again.</p>
        <p>"In the box..." The Captain's studied eyes scan the horizon one last time as T.H.E. Kingfish roars to life. The sea parts itself as it once did for Moses, and the vessel obliges, carried towards the sunrise and the bounty that awaits.</p>

        <h2>The Old Sea Captain's Mantra</h2>
        <p>Communication is key on any vessel, and especially so on T.H.E. Kingfish. After all, the sea does not surrender its treasures freely! A good crew must work together to extract them from the depths, and every second counts. If ye seek to return to port with a full chest, study these words carefully.</p>
        <h3>POPPER DOWN!</h3>
        <p>Your quarry has struck, taking the bait on promise of an easy meal. Don't be fooled though, as a false start could mean wasted bait. Only when the cork is fully submerged, alert your Captain with a hearty "POPPER DOWN!" and swing the rod up swiftly to set the hook.</p>
        <h3>FISH ON!</h3>
        <p>The sea is a fickle mistress, and its constituents are in no mood to leave it. Even the most forceful bite doesn't always result in a hooked fish. If the pull is sustained after setting the hook, make sure your crew is aware by shouting "FISH ON!"</p>
        <h3>IN THE BOX!</h3>
        <p>After you have wrestled with the deep and secured your bounty aboard the vessel, your Captain will measure your catch to determine whether or not it is a keeper. The sea gives and takes in equal measure, and her rules (as well as the game warden's) must be respected.</p>
